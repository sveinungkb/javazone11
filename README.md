# Automated Android testing using Jenkins CIThis is an example project used at the JavaZone 2011 conference to show how Android JUnit tests can be ran on a CI server like Jenkins.The tests can run on an actual device or the emulator. A custom ant target is created to run the tests (ant run-tests) and pull the XML report from the device. The InstrumentationTestRunner.java that creates XML reports on the device is part of the [nbandroid][http://code.google.com/p/nbandroid-utils/] project.Slides are available at [SlideShare][http://www.slideshare.net/sveinungkb/automated-android-testing-using-jenkins-ci]If you have any questions, feel free to ask them here in the comments field or you can send me an email at "sb \o/ giantleap.com".# Important ant targets| Folder  | Target               | Description                                                             || jz.test | test-and-pull-report | Will run all unit tests and pull JUnit XML report                       ||         |                      |(that can be used in Jenkins/Hudons) from device/emulator                || jz.test | run-tests            | Runs the unit tests in the test project                                 || jz.test | coverage             | Runs the unit tests and records test coverage using Emma                || jz      | install              | Compiles and installs the application on dev/emulator                   || jz      | release              | Will sign and release your application, perfect for automatic building! |
