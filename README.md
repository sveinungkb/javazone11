## Automated Android testing using Jenkins CIThis is an example project used in my [talk](http://vimeo.com/28719689) at the [JavaZone 2011](http://www.javazone.no) conference to show how Android JUnit tests can be ran on a CI server like Jenkins.The tests will run on an actual device or the Android emulator. A custom ant target is created to run the tests (ant run-tests) and pull the XML report from the device. The InstrumentationTestRunner.java that creates XML reports on the device is part of the [nbandroid](http://code.google.com/p/nbandroid-utils/) project.Slides are available at [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/sveinungkb/automated-android-testing-using-jenkins-ci)If you have any questions, feel free to ask them here in the comments field or at http://twitter.com/sveinungkb.## Important ant targets	Folder	Target					Description	jz.test	test-and-pull-report	Will run all unit tests and pull JUnit XML report 									(that can be used in Jenkins/Hudons) from device/emulator 		jz.test	run-tests				Runs the unit tests in the test project		jz.test	coverage				Runs the unit tests and records test coverage using Emma 		jz	 	install					Compiles and installs the application on dev/emulator 		jz		release					Will sign and release your application, perfect 									for automatic building! 		## Important files### jz.test\build.xmlThis is the file containing the custom ant target *test-and-pull-report* that will run the unit tests and pull the results from the device.### jz.test\build.propertiesThe file for shared build properties for the test project (this one you want in your CVS, local.properties you ignore), important here is the *test.runner* property that ensures that our InstrumentationTestRunner is used during testing.### jz.test\AndroidManifest.xmlTest project's manifest, note the reference to our custom *test runner*.### jz\build.xml No customization done in this proejct, but custom build targets can be added, very useful for repeated building.
